# 2.5D Puzzle Game

## Overview
This project is a **multidisciplinary 2.5D puzzle game** in which the player manipulates **power generators** to supply energy and activate various mechanisms within the levels.

The gameplay focuses on **thinking**, **observation**, and **understanding interactions** between generators and the environment. Each puzzle challenges the player to logically route energy in order to progress.

The project is developed in a **collaborative context**, involving multiple disciplines:
- **Game Design**: puzzle design, mechanics, and progression
- **Game Programming**: system implementation, controls, and interactions
- **Sound Design**: soundscapes, audio feedback, and sound effects
